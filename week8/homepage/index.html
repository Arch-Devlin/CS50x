                        Fantasy is a genre of speculative fiction set in a fictional universe,
                        often inspired by real world myth and folklore. Its roots are in oral traditions,
                        which then became fantasy literature and drama.
                        From the twentieth century it has expanded further into various media, including film,
                        television, graphic novels, manga, animated movies and video games.
                        <br>
                        Fantasy is distinguished from the genres of science fiction and horror by the respective absence of scientific or macabre themes,
                        though these genres overlap. In popular culture, the fantasy genre predominantly features settings of a medieval nature.
                        In its broadest sense, however, fantasy consists of works by many writers, artists, filmmakers,
                        and musicians from ancient myths and legends to many recent and popular works.

                        Science fiction (sometimes shortened to sci-fi or SF)
                        is a genre of speculative fiction that typically deals with imaginative and futuristic concepts such as advanced science and technology,
                        space exploration, time travel, parallel universes, and extraterrestrial life.
                        It has been called the "literature of ideas", and often explores the potential consequences of scientific,
                        social, and technological innovations, able to criticize present-day society, and is often said to inspire a "sense of wonder".
                        <br>
                        Science fiction, whose roots go back to ancient times, is related to fantasy, horror, and superhero fiction,
                        and contains many subgenres. Its exact definition has long been disputed among authors, critics, scholars, and readers.

                        Xianxia is a genre commonly found in Eastern fantasy fiction. It is similar, though different, to Wuxia.
                        <br>
                        The genre is based in a martial arts world, where there is anarchy and chaos and one needs to be strong to survive or be respected.
                        <br>
                        The Protagonist and most of the characters are "cultivators" or "practitioners".
                        Cultivators or Practitioners are those who seek to become Xian (immortals) or powerful God like figures beyond immortality.
                        <br>
                        To become Gods or immortals and attain eternal life, supernatural powers and incredible levels of strength,
                        these characters cultivate by training their martial arts.
                        <br>
                        The fictional martial arts, practices,
                        or training that occur within the xianxia genre are based around the real-life meditation practice Qigong.
                        It is influenced by Taoist beliefs and medicinal practices such as acupuncture or alchemy.
                        <br>
                        While training the characters meditate and use Qi
                        to hone their bodies and souls so that they can better themselves and gain enlightenment.
