                <p class="card-text">One day, Song Shuhang was suddenly added to a chat group with many seniors that suffered from chuuni disease.
                The people inside the group would call each other ‘Fellow Daoist’ and had all different kinds of titles:
                Palace Master, Cave Lord, True Monarch, Immortal Master, etc.
                Even the pet of the founder of the group that had run away from home was called ‘monster dog’.
                They would talk all day about pill refining, exploring ancient ruins,
                or share their experience on techniques.
                <br>
                However, after lurking inside the group for a while, he discovered that not all was what it seemed...</p>

                  <h6 class="Blurb">Blurb</h6>
                  <p class="card-text">With the rising tide of steam power and machinery,
                  who can come close to being a Beyonder? Shrouded in the fog of history and darkness,
                  who or what is the lurking evil that murmurs into our ears?
                  <br>
                  Waking up to be faced with a string of mysteries,
                  Zhou Mingrui finds himself reincarnated as Klein Moretti
                  in an alternate Victorian era world where he sees a world filled with machinery,
                  cannons, dreadnoughts, airships, difference machines, as well as Potions,
                  Divination, Hexes, Tarot Cards, Sealed Artifacts…
                  <br>
                  The Light continues to shine but mystery has never gone far.
                  Follow Klein as he finds himself entangled with the Churches
                  of the world—both orthodox and unorthodox—while he slowly develops
                  newfound powers thanks to the Beyonder potions.
                  <br>
                  Like the corresponding tarot card, The Fool,
                  which is numbered 0—a number of unlimited potential—this is the legend of "The Fool."</p>
